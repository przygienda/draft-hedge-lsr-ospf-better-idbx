            <t>
                 When an OSPF router undergoes restart, the previous incarnations of the LSAs belonging to that router
                 may still linger in the database of other routers in the OSPF domain until such LSAs are aged out.
                Hence, when the restarting
                 router joins the network again, neighboring routers re-establish adjacencies while the
                 restarting router is still bringing-up its interfaces and adjacencies and generates LSAs with
                version numbers that may be lower than the stale LSAs. Such stale LSAs may be interpreted as bi-directional
                connectivity before the initial database exchanges are finished and genuine connectivity exists.
                Such incorrect interpretation may lead to, among others, to
                 transient traffic blackholes. This document suggests improvements in the OSPF database exchange
                process to prevent such problems due to stale LSA misinterpretation. The solution does not precondition
                changes in the existing standard but presents an extension that will prevent the scenario.

            <t>
               When an OSPF <xref target ='RFC2328'/> router restarts, it's stale LSAs are left in the
               database of the other routers in the OSPF domain until the LSAs are aged out either intentionally
                or by natural decay over time. The stale
                Router LSA can contain links to all the neighbors that had adjacencies Up before the router
                 restarted.

                 <xref target ='Topology_1'/> shows a very simple OSPF network. In case of C undergoing restart that
                does not generate purges, the other routers
                 in the domain will hold the stale LSA of Router C in their database. The stale LSA may have links to B and E,
                 which represents the topology of C before it went down. When C restarts again,
                 it initiates database exchange process with B and E. B and E may have C's stale LSA with higher
                 sequence number in their database than the new ones originated by C and
                hence assume this being the latest copy successively bringin up the adjacency
                 with C and transition to Full state as well. Based on C's Stale LSA having B and E link in the LSA,
                back-link check is
                 satisfied and B and E update their routing table to point to C. This may cause traffic blackhole 
                 as C may not have the adjacency up and all LSAs in place to program the  necessary routes correctly.

               <t>
                    The database exchange procedure from <xref target ='RFC2328'/> section 7.2 is extended and additional
                    optional procedure added as below.</t>
                 <t>   
                    During Database exchange when a router receives an LSA from the neighbor for which such neighbor is the originator
                    of the LSA and the sequence number of the LSA is smaller than its own database copy, the receiving router marks
                    its own database copy as stale. Router sends LSReq for such newly stale marked LSA with the
                      received sequence number. Until an LSA with
                    the sequence number greater than its own database copy is received (or strictly speaking, _newer_
                     LSA based on usual comparison), this LSReq MUST not be satisfied and the adjacency FSM
                      MUST NOT move to Full state.</t>
               <section title="Example" anchor='sec_ex'>
                    <t>  <xref target ='seq_dgm'/> provides an example of C restarting having originated an LSA with sequence number
                         Y before. After restarting C originates the same LSA with sequence number X where X &lt; Y since
                        it is not aware of existence of version X yet.

                            As shown in figure <xref target ='seq_dgm'/> above, E originates LSReq with Sequence number X but
                         waits until the LSA with sequence number Y+1 (or strictly speaking, an LSA that compares as newer
                        to the one it holds) arrives. As the LSA is still in the LSReq queue, the adjacency
                         will remain in Loading state and will not move to Full state. All the neighbors of the restarting routers 
                         hold the neighborship in Loading state and do not make it Full until the stale LSA is replaced with the new LSA
                         with higher sequence number than the stale LSA. This ensures that other routers in the network do not compute
                         a path through the restarting router since they cannot satisfy the bi-directionality condition
                        in reachability computations.
