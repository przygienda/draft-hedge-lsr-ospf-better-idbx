                 When an OSPF router undergoes restart, the previous incarnations of the LSAs belonging to that router
                 still linger in the database of other routers in the OSPF domain until they are Maxaged. When the restarting
                 router comes back, neighboring routers establish adjacency with the restarting router while the 
                 restarting router is still bringing-up the interfaces and adjacencies. The combination of stale LSA
                 of the restarting router in the database and the new LSA from adjacenct routers may get interpreted as,
                 connectivity being established through the restarting router. This incorrect interpretation may cause
                 traffic blackhole. This document suggests improvements in the OSPF database exchange process to prevent
                 traffic blackhole due to stale LSA misinterpretation.

               When an OSPF <xref target ='RFC2328'/> router restarts, it's stale LSAs are left in the
               database of the other routers in the OSPF domain until the LSAs are MaxAged. The stale
                Router LSA contains links to all the neighbors that had adjacencies Up before the router
                 restarted.

                 <xref target ='Topology_1'/> describes an OSPF network. When C undergoes restart, the other routers
                 in the domain hold the stale LSA on Router C in their database. The stale LSA may have links to B and E,
                 which represents the topology of C before it went for restart. When C comes up,
                 it initiates database exchange process with B and E. B and E have C's stale LSA with higher 
                 sequence number in their database and assume it is the latest copy and bring up the adjacency 
                 with C and go to Full state. Based on C's Stale LSA having B and E link in the LSA back-link check is
                 satisfied and B and E update their routing table to point to C. This may cause traffic blackhole 
                 as C may not have the adjacency up and the routes programmed correctly.
