Abstract

   When an OSPF router undergoes restart, previous instances of LSAs
   belonging to that router may remain in the databases of other routers
   in the OSPF domain until such LSAs are aged out.  Hence, when the
   restarting router joins the network again, neighboring routers re-
   establish adjacencies while the restarting router is still bringing-
   up its interfaces and adjacencies and generates LSAs with sequence
   numbers that may be lower than the stale LSAs.  Such stale LSAs may
   be interpreted as bi-directional connectivity before the initial
   database exchanges are finished and genuine bi-directional LSA
   connectivity exists.  Such incorrect interpretation may lead to,
   among other thiegs, transient traffic packect drops.  This document
   suggests improvements in the OSPF database exchange process to
   prevent such problems due to stale LSA utilization.  The solution
   does not preclude changes in the existing standard but presents an
   extension that will prevent this scenario.

1.  Introduction

   When an OSPF [RFC2328] router restarts, its stale LSAs are left in
   the database of other routers in the OSPF domain until the LSAs are
   aged out either intentionally or by the LSA age elapsing.  The stale
   Router LSA can contain links to all the neighbors that had
   adjacencies Up before the router restarted.

                           Figure 1: OSPF Network

   Figure 1 shows a very simple OSPF network.  In case of C undergoing
   restart that does not generate purges, the other routers in the
   domain will hold the stale LSA of Router C in their database.  The
   stale LSA may have links to B and E, which represents the topology of
   C before it went down.  When C restarts again, it initiates the
   database exchange process with B and E.  B and E may have C's stale
   LSA with a higher sequence number in their database than the new ones
   originated by C and hence assume this is latest copy, successively
   bringing up the adjacency with C, and transitioning to Full state.
   Based on C's Stale LSA having LSA links to B and E, the Shortest Path
   First (SPF) back-link check is satisfied and B and E update their
   routing table to point to C.  This may cause C to drop this traffic
   as C may not have all its previous adjacencies up and all LSAs in
   place to correctly compute the necessary routes.

2.  Solution

   The database exchange procedure from [RFC2328] section 7.2 is
   extended with additional constraints to prevent an OSPF router from
   transitioning to Full state when it has stale LSAs originated by the
   database exchange neighbor in its Link State Database (LSDB).

   During Database exchange, when a router receives an LSA from the
   neighbor for which such neighbor is the originator of the LSA and the
   sequence number of the LSA is smaller than the sequence number of its
   database copy, the receiving router marks its database copy as stale.
   The router will add this stale LSA to the Link State Request List for
   the neighbor.  This LSA MUST NOT be removed from the Link State
   Request list and the adjacency FSM MUST NOT transition to Full state
   until an LSA with a sequence number greater than its own database
   copy is received (or strictly speaking, a "more recent" LSA).

2.1.  Example

   Figure 2 provides an example of C restarting having originated an LSA
   with sequence number Y before.  After restarting C originates the
   same LSA with sequence number X where X < Y since it is not aware of
   existence of version X yet.

                                     Satisfied



               Figure 2: Modified Database Exchange Procedure

   As shown in figure Figure 2 above, E originates LSReq with Sequence
   number X but waits until the LSA with sequence number Y+1 (or
   strictly speaking, an LSA that compares as newer to the one it holds)
   arrives.  As the LSA is still in the LSReq queue, the adjacency will
   remain in Loading state and will not move to Full state.  All the
   neighbors of the restarting routers hold the neighborship in Loading
   state and do not make it Full until the stale LSA is replaced with
   the new LSA with higher sequence number than the stale LSA.  This
   ensures that other routers in the network do not compute a path
   through the restarting router since they cannot satisfy the bi-
   directionality condition in SPF computations.
