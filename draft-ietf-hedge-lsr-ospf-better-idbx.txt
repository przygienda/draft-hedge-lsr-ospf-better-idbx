Abstract

   When an OSPF router undergoes restart, the previous incarnations of
   the LSAs belonging to that router may still linger in the database of
   other routers in the OSPF domain until such LSAs are aged out.
   Hence, when the restarting router joins the network again,
   neighboring routers re-establish adjacencies while the restarting
   router is still bringing-up its interfaces and adjacencies and
   generates LSAs with version numbers that may be lower than the stale
   LSAs.  Such stale LSAs may be interpreted as bi-directional
   connectivity before the initial database exchanges are finished and
   genuine connectivity exists.  Such incorrect interpretation may lead
   to, among others, to transient traffic blackholes.  This document
   suggests improvements in the OSPF database exchange process to
   prevent such problems due to stale LSA misinterpretation.  The
   solution does not precondition changes in the existing standard but
   presents an extension that will prevent the scenario.

1.  Introduction

   When an OSPF [RFC2328] router restarts, it's stale LSAs are left in
   the database of the other routers in the OSPF domain until the LSAs
   are aged out either intentionally or by natural decay over time.  The
   stale Router LSA can contain links to all the neighbors that had
   adjacencies Up before the router restarted.

                           Figure 1: OSPF Network

   Figure 1 shows a very simple OSPF network.  In case of C undergoing
   restart that does not generate purges, the other routers in the
   domain will hold the stale LSA of Router C in their database.  The
   stale LSA may have links to B and E, which represents the topology of
   C before it went down.  When C restarts again, it initiates database
   exchange process with B and E.  B and E may have C's stale LSA with
   higher sequence number in their database than the new ones originated
   by C and hence assume this being the latest copy successively bringin
   up the adjacency with C and transition to Full state as well.  Based
   on C's Stale LSA having B and E link in the LSA, back-link check is
   satisfied and B and E update their routing table to point to C.  This
   may cause traffic blackhole as C may not have the adjacency up and
   all LSAs in place to program the necessary routes correctly.

2.  Solution

   The database exchange procedure from [RFC2328] section 7.2 is
   extended and additional optional procedure added as below.

   During Database exchange when a router receives an LSA from the
   neighbor for which such neighbor is the originator of the LSA and the
   sequence number of the LSA is smaller than its own database copy, the
   receiving router marks its own database copy as stale.  Router sends
   LSReq for such newly stale marked LSA with the received sequence
   number.  Until an LSA with the sequence number greater than its own
   database copy is received (or strictly speaking, _newer_ LSA based on
   usual comparison), this LSReq MUST not be satisfied and the adjacency
   FSM MUST NOT move to Full state.

2.1.  Example

   Figure 2 provides an example of C restarting having originated an LSA
   with sequence number Y before.  After restarting C originates the
   same LSA with sequence number X where X < Y since it is not aware of
   existence of version X yet.

                                     Satisfied



               Figure 2: Modified Database Exchange Procedure

   As shown in figure Figure 2 above, E originates LSReq with Sequence
   number X but waits until the LSA with sequence number Y+1 (or
   strictly speaking, an LSA that compares as newer to the one it holds)
   arrives.  As the LSA is still in the LSReq queue, the adjacency will
   remain in Loading state and will not move to Full state.  All the
   neighbors of the restarting routers hold the neighborship in Loading
   state and do not make it Full until the stale LSA is replaced with
   the new LSA with higher sequence number than the stale LSA.  This
   ensures that other routers in the network do not compute a path
   through the restarting router since they cannot satisfy the bi-
   directionality condition in reachability computations.
